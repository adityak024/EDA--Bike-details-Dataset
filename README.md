# 🏍️ EDA--Bike-details-Dataset
Exploratory Data Analysis on a used bike dataset to uncover insights into the second-hand bike market, including pricing trends, usage patterns, and key resale factors.

This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a dataset of **used bikes**, aiming to uncover insights into the second-hand bike market. The dataset includes various features like brand, model, year of purchase, kilometers driven, fuel type, ownership details, and selling price.

---

## 📌 Objective

- Analyze factors that affect the **resale value** of used bikes
- Understand **usage patterns** based on year, distance, and ownership
- Identify **market trends**, popular brands, and price distributions
- Clean and visualize the dataset to derive actionable insights

---

## 📂 Dataset Overview

The dataset includes the following columns:
- `Brand`: Manufacturer of the bike
- `Model`: Specific model name
- `Year`: Year of purchase
- `Kilometers_Driven`: Distance covered
- `Fuel_Type`: Petrol/Diesel/Electric
- `Owner`: First, Second, or Third owner
- `Selling_Price`: Listed resale price

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas** – data wrangling
- **NumPy** – numerical operations
- **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn** – data visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook** – interactive analysis

## 📊 Key Steps in Analysis

1. **Data Cleaning**
   - Handling missing values
   - Fixing data types
   - Removing duplicates and outliers

2. **Univariate Analysis**
   - Distribution of prices, years, kilometers driven

3. **Bivariate Analysis**
   - Correlation between price and features
   - Fuel type vs. price
   - Ownership vs. resale value

4. **Visualizations**
   - Histograms, bar charts, boxplots, scatter plots

5. **Insights & Observations**
   - Summary of findings to support decision-making

## 📈 Sample Visualizations

*(Add images or links to charts from your notebook)*

## 💡 Insights

- Newer bikes with fewer kilometers tend to have higher resale value.
- First-owner bikes are significantly more valuable than second or third-owner bikes.
- Petrol bikes dominate the used bike market, but electric bikes show emerging presence.
- Certain brands hold value better over time.
